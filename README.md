# Tamil Bible 1957 Edition

*As typos are found in the text, fixing them in multiple places is unreliable. So, it is decided to have a single source for the bible text, the [TFBF's tamil bible repository](https://github.com/tfbf/Bible-Tamil-Sathiyavedam-1957). The scripts here are functional, but further updates will be made to the TFBF's tamil bible repository.*

Digital copy of the Tamil Bible Old Version published by Bible Society of India and Ceylon in the year 1957. This Bible is in Public Domain in India. Digitization was done by TFBF (www.tfbf.in) volunteers and the scanned images of the pages of this Bible can be downloaded from https://archive.org/details/Tamil-Bible-BSI-OV-1957.

## Code

This repository also has a few scripts to convert between different formats.

1. `usfm_to_md.py` -> USFM to Markdown
2. `usfm_to_png.py` -> USFM to PNG (use [https://gitlab.com/berinaniesh/](https://gitlab.com/berinaniesh/bible-verse-placards) instead, it converts to pdf and the pdf can be converted to images easily)
3. `usfm_to_db.py` -> Push the bible to a PostgreSQL database (The database schema can be found in `schema.sql`)
